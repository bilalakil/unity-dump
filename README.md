# Tips

## Unity

### iOS

- Check "Bottom" in "Project Settings > Player > iOS > Other Settings > Defer system gestures on edges"
    - Otherwise the home indicator on some iPhones will be too easy to activate

### Android

- Disable "Project Settings > Player > Android > Resolution and Presentation > Render Over Native UI"
    - Otherwise some devices will have their OS visible behind the game
